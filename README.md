# Ghost_Bus_Detector-GTFS-
Real Time Ghost Bus Tracker, a system that keeps track of live bus activity and flags "Ghost Buses,” which are buses shown in schedules but missing in real life. It’s built with FastAPI, Redis, and React, processes live "GTFS data", and shows everything on an interactive map with real-time alerts and analytics.
